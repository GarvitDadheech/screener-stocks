# Stock Screening Tool Documentation

## Overview

The **Stock Screening Tool** is a web-based application that allows users to filter and view stocks based on a variety of criteria. Inspired by the "Create New Screen" feature on Screener.in, the application replicates the functionality and user experience of creating custom stock screens, focusing on delivering a seamless, intuitive, and powerful stock screening tool.

This tool allows users to input a series of filters in a query format to view stocks that meet their selected conditions. The application supports **AND** and **OR** logical operators, enabling users to fine-tune their stock searches based on multiple parameters.

## Features

- **Filter Criteria Input**: Users can input filter conditions in a query-like format, supporting parameters like Market Capitalization, P/E Ratio, ROE, and more.
- **AND/OR Logic**: Allows for flexible screening based on both AND-only and OR-based conditions.
- **Sorting**: Stocks can be sorted based on each parameter, including Market Capitalization, P/E Ratio, ROE, etc.
- **Pagination**: Results are paginated to display up to 10, 25 or 50 stocks per page.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile devices.

  The filters are entered sequentially, and each condition must be met for a stock to be included in the results.

  - **OR**: At least one condition must be met (optional in advanced scenarios).

### Screening Logic

- **Stock Evaluation**: Stocks are evaluated based on the specified criteria.
- **Filter Matching**: The filters are applied in real-time, showing only the stocks that meet all conditions specified by the user.

### Results Display

- **Tabular Format**: Stocks that meet the filter criteria are displayed in a table, with columns for each of the 9 parameters.
- **Sorting**: Users can sort the results by any of the 9 parameters.
